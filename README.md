# OOP - Object-Oriented Programming

### OOP Concepts:
  1. Classes and Object
  2. Encapsulation
  3. Inheritance
  4. Polymorphism
  5. Abstraction

#### Let's Understand each concepts in details:-

#### 1. Classes and Objects:

   - Class: A class is a **blueprint or template** for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior (attributes and methods) that the objects created from it will have.
   - Object: An object is an instance of a class. It is a real-world entity that has its own state and behavior.
   
#### 2. Encapsulation: 

   - which means that each class is just like **a capsule** that contains everything it needs and nothing more.
   - In Java, Encapsulation is the concept of hiding the internal details (data) of an object and exposing only the necessary functionality through public methods (getters and setters).

#### 3. Inheritance:

   - allows one class to **inherit properties and methods from another class**.
   - This promotes code reusability and the creation of a hierarchy of classes.

#### 4. Polymorphism: 

   - which means **multiples shapes or forms**.
   - In Java, Polymorphism achieved through method overriding (in subclasses) and method overloading (within the same class).
     - **Method Overriding:** Subclasses can provide their own implementation of a method that is already defined in the superclass.
     - **Method Overloading**: Methods in the same class can have the same name but different parameters (number, type, or order).

#### 5. Abstraction:
   - is the concept of **hiding complex implementation details** and **showing only the necessary functionality** to the user.
   - In Java, abstraction can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.
